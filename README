------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION:

This CGI (or other) script acts as an HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP proxy.  Through it,
you can retrieve any resource that is accessible from the server this runs on.
This is useful when your own access is limited, but you can reach a server
that in turn can reach others that you can't.  By default, no user info
(except browser type) is sent to the target server, so you can set up your
own anonymous proxy.

Whenever an HTML resource is retrieved, it's modified so that all links
in it point back through the same proxy, including images, form submissions,
and everything else.  JavaScript and Flash apps are similarly "proxified".
Once you're using the proxy, you can browse normally and (almost) forget
it's there.

CGIProxy can run in four ways: as a CGI script, as a mod_perl script, as a
FastCGI script, or with its own embedded secure HTTP server.  Configurable
options include text-only proxying (to save bandwidth), selective cookie and
script removal, simple ad filtering, access restriction by server, custom
encoding of target URLs and cookies, and more-- there are more than 70 options
so far (see the complete list of configuration options below).  It requires
Perl 5.6.1 or later.

The original seed for this was a program I wrote for Rich Morin's
article in the June 1996 issue of Unix Review, online at
http://www.cfcl.com/tin/P/199606.shtml .

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ANONYMOUS BROWSING:
CGIProxy was originally made for indirect browsing more than anonymity,
but since people are using it for anonymity, I've tried to make it as
anonymous as possible.  Suggestions welcome.  For best anonymity, browse
with JavaScript turned off, or configure CGIProxy to remove script
content (see the options below).   Also, be aware that Flash or other
executable content may be able to reveal you to a server, though CGIProxy
tries to prevent that too.  Please tell me if you find any way that
anonymity can be compromised when using CGIProxy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. LEGAL DISCLAIMER:

Censorship is a controversial subject, and some governments and companies
have rules about what information you should have access to.  If you use
my software to bypass rules that have been imposed on you, you assume all
legal risks and responsibilities involved.  I'm providing the software as
a demonstration and teaching tool, and for when legitimate access is
needed to non-accessible servers.  I won't encourage you to break any
rules, because I would get in trouble if I did.  I can't prevent you from
using this software in illegitimate ways, but I believe the value of it in
its many uses is far too great to let a few miscreants ruin it for
everybody.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. INSTALLATION:

This section is much longer than it used to be, and more complete.  You won't
need most of it.  The installation itself is easier and more flexible than it
used to be.  Parts of it require running commands from the command line (the
"shell"), but we'll tell you exactly which commands you need to run. 

You need to install CGIProxy on a machine that's outside of any censoring
firewall, but that is still accessible to people behind the firewall. You do
NOT need to install anything on the browsing machine(s). Once CGIProxy is
installed on a machine, any number of people can use it, if they know its URL.

Subsections within this INSTALLATION section include:

    AFTER YOU INSTALL
    TROUBLESHOOTING
        IF YOU DON'T KNOW PERL, BUT NEED TO CONFIGURE CGIPROXY 


PREREQUISITES:

CGIProxy requires the following on the machine where it is installed:

    - the Perl language, which is already on all Unix and Mac OS X machines
    - secure (!) Web server software, such as Apache or nginx (unless
      installing CGIProxy using its own embedded server)
    - OpenSSL, which is already on most Unix and Mac machines.  To see if you
      already have OpenSSL, run "openssl version" from the command line to see
      either the installed version or an error message.

Please note that all of these packages are completely unaffiliated with
CGIProxy, and may have their own terms of use.


CONFIGURING CGIPROXY:

First, unpack the distribution (the file ending in ".tar.gz").  On Unix and
Mac, you can do this with the command "tar xzvf cgiproxy.*.tar.gz".  In it are
two files, nph-proxy.cgi and README .  nph-proxy.cgi is the program you'll be
configuring and installing. That's it-- just one file.

Almost all configuration is optional, and the defaults should be fine for most
situations.  However, if you need to set an HTTP proxy, or there is anything
else unusual about your network or server, then see the section OPTIONS RELATED
TO YOUR SERVER/NETWORK ENVIRONMENT.  In particular, set $PROXY_DIR and $RUN_AS_USER .
If you don't have root access on your server, then set $LOCAL_LIB_DIR .

Configure CGIProxy by editing nph-proxy.cgi in a text editor.  The
configuration section starts after some initial comments and code, near line
338.  Each configuration variable has a block of text above it fully describing
how to use it; there's a summary table of all options online.  If you don't
know Perl, there's some help at the end of this INSTALLATION section.

Depending on how you install CGIProxy, there may be other configuration needed.
This will be detailed for each of the installation methods below.

You can rename nph-proxy.cgi if you like. However, if you're installing it as
a CGI script or under mod_perl, be sure the name still starts with "nph-".
(You can change that requirement for mod_perl, by reconfiguring mod_perl.)
These instructions will still refer to "nph-proxy.cgi", but you should substitute
the actual name of your file.


USING A DATABASE:

As of CGIProxy 2.1.15, the default database driver is SQLite, which means you
don't need to run a database engine (like MariaDB/MySQL or Oracle) to use a
database-- SQLite simply uses a file for its database, which for CGIProxy is in
the directory "cgiproxy/sqlite/" under your home directory, with the filename
"cgiproxy". (This location and filename can be configured if needed.) Using a
database is optional, but it will get rid of any "Bad Request" errors you see
when you have too many cookies for your Web server to handle.

You'll need to purge old data from your database periodically. In Unix or Mac,
do this with a "cron job". In Windows, use the Task Scheduler. The command to
purge the database is "nph-proxy.cgi purge-db".

All database configuration in CGIProxy is described in the section DATABASE
CONFIGURATION OPTIONS.

You'll need to purge old data from your database periodically. In Unix or Mac,
do this with a "cron job". In Windows, use the Task Scheduler. The command to
purge the database is "nph-proxy.cgi purge-db".

In Unix or Mac, you can edit your list of cron jobs (one per line) with the
command "crontab -e". To purge the database at the top of every hour, add the
line:

    0 * * * * /path/to/script/nph-proxy.cgi purge-db 

To purge the database every night at 2:00 am, add the line:

    0 2 * * * /path/to/script/nph-proxy.cgi purge-db 

(Replace "/path/to/script/" with the full path to nph-proxy.cgi .) 


INSTALLING THE CGIPROXY SCRIPT:

There are four ways to run CGIProxy:

    - as a CGI script (the easiest, but runs the slowest)
    - under mod_perl (requires Apache with the mod_perl extension)
    - as a FastCGI script
    - using CGIProxy's own embedded server (doesn't need Web server software)

Read the section below corresponding to the way you want to run it.


AS A CGI SCRIPT:

This is the easiest way to install CGIProxy, but it will run the slowest of
all four installation methods. However, if not too many people are using it,
the speed may be OK. To install CGIProxy:

    1) Copy the file nph-proxy.cgi onto your Web server somewhere, but not at
       the top Web directory, or else it will be easily discovered.
    2) Change the file's permissions to be executable.  On Unix and Mac, you
       can do this with the command "chmod +x nph-proxy.cgi"; there are other
       ways.
    3) In the directory where you copied nph-proxy.cgi, run the command
       "./nph-proxy.cgi init" (or in Windows, "perl nph-proxy.cgi init").
       This installs the optional Perl modules to e.g. let you visit secure
       sites.  If you can't run this as root/administrator, it will still
       work, but see the instructions displayed at the end after all the
       scrolling text (which you can ignore).  If it asks you any questions,
       you can just hit <return>.
    4) If you're using a database, add the cron job to purge old data-- see
       the section USING A DATABASE above.
    5) Optionally, protect the proxy with a password; see your Web server
       documentation for how to do this.  With Apache, you can use the
       .htaccess file.


UNDER MOD_PERL:

If you have mod_perl available on your Apache server (ask your webmaster), then
with it CGIProxy can run many times faster than as a CGI script.  The
installation is similar to that of a CGI script, but requires some extra Apache
configuration if mod_perl hasn't already been set up.  To install CGIProxy
under mod_perl, do the same thing as installing it as a CGI script, above.
Depending on how mod_perl is configured, you may need to rename the script file
to nph-proxy.pl, or something else.

CONFIGURING MOD_PERL:

If you're configuring your own mod_perl, you can use this block in your
httpd.conf to make all scripts ending in ".pl" use mod_perl:

    <Files *.pl>
	Options +ExecCGI
	SetHandler perl-script
	PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
	PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
	PerlSendHeader Off
	<Files nph-*>
	    PerlOptions -ParseHeaders
	</Files>
    </Files>
    	

If you know how to configure Apache, you can tweak this as desired.


AS A FASTCGI SCRIPT:

FastCGI scripts are similar to CGI scripts in some ways, but run faster than
CGI scripts.  FastCGI can be used with most Web servers, including those that
don't support CGI scripts, such as nginx.  A FastCGI script runs as multiple
managed processes on a server, and is called by the Web server process.

To install CGIProxy as a FastCGI script:

    1) Set $SECRET_PATH, and possibly $FCGI_SOCKET .  Other configurable
       parameters are listed in FASTCGI CONFIGURATION OPTIONS.
    2) Configure your Web server to use the same two values you set in the
       previous step (see the next sections for examples).
    3) Copy nph-proxy.cgi to your server machine.  Do not put it under your
       Web directory.
    4) Change the file's permissions to be executable.  On Unix and Mac, you
       can do this with the command "chmod +x nph-proxy.cgi"; there are other
       ways. 
    5) In the directory where you copied nph-proxy.cgi, run the command
       "./nph-proxy.cgi init" (or in Windows, "perl nph-proxy.cgi init").
       This installs the optional Perl modules to e.g. let you visit secure
       sites.  If you can't run this as root/administrator, it will still
       work, but see the instructions displayed at the end after all the
       scrolling text (which you can ignore).  If it asks you any questions,
       you can just hit <return>.
    6) If you're using a database, add the cron job to purge old data-- see
       the section USING A DATABASE above.

To start the FastCGI process, run the command "./nph-proxy.cgi start-fcgi"
(or in Windows, "perl nph-proxy.cgi start-fcgi") from the directory where you
uploaded the script.  It may take a while the first time you run it, as it will
install some required Perl modules if you don't already have them; you can
ignore the scrolling text.  If it asks you any questions, you can just hit
<return>.

To stop the FastCGI process, run the command "killall nph-proxy.cgi".

CONFIGURING NGINX WITH FASTCGI:

Include a section like this in your nginx.conf, within the secure server section:

    location /secret/ {
        include        fastcgi.conf;
        fastcgi_pass   unix:/tmp/cgiproxy.fcgi.socket;
    }

Replace "/secret/" with your setting of $SECRET_PATH, and replace
"/tmp/cgiproxy.fcgi.socket" with your setting of $FCGI_SOCKET .

CONFIGURING APACHE WITH FASTCGI:

Include a line like this in your httpd.conf:

    FastCgiExternalServer /var/www/html/secret -socket /tmp/cgiproxy.fcgi.socket

Replace "/var/www/html/secret" with your setting of $SECRET_PATH appended to
your DocumentRoot, and replace "/tmp/cgiproxy.fcgi.socket" with your setting
of $FCGI_SOCKET .


USING CGIPROXY'S OWN EMBEDDED SERVER:

You can run CGIProxy without a Web server, using its embedded server.  This
method will run faster than as a CGI script, but probably slower than under
mod_perl or as a FastCGI script.

To run any secure server, including CGIProxy's embedded server, you need a
"certificate" and a "private key", also known as a "key pair".  (A certificate
contains a "public key".)  To get a key pair, you can either buy one from a
certificate authority, or you can generate your own "self-signed" key pair.
The disadvantage of using a self-signed key pair is that your users will see
a browser warning about an untrusted certificate.  This is true of any secure
server.

To install CGIProxy using its own embedded server:

    1) Set $SECRET_PATH.
    2) Copy your certificate and private key, both in PEM format, into the
       ".cgiproxy" directory under your home directory (or whatever you may
       have set $PROXY_DIR to).
    3) Set $CERTIFICATE_FILE and $PRIVATE_KEY_FILE to the file names from the
       previous step.
    4) Optionally, you can password-protect your proxy by setting $EMB_USERNAME
       and $EMB_PASSWORD.
    5) If you intend to run CGIProxy as root (superuser), then it's highly
       recommended that you set $RUN_AS_USER to the user that CGIProxy should
       have the permissions of (i.e. NOT root).
    6) Copy nph-proxy.cgi to your server machine.  Do not put it under your Web
       directory.
    7) Change the file's permissions to be executable.  On Unix and Mac, you
       can do this with the command "chmod +x nph-proxy.cgi"; there are other
       ways.
    8) In the directory where you copied nph-proxy.cgi, run the command
       "./nph-proxy.cgi init" (or in Windows, "perl nph-proxy.cgi init").
       This installs the optional Perl modules to e.g. let you visit secure
       sites.  If you can't run this as root/administrator, it will still
       work, but see the instructions displayed at the end after all the
       scrolling text (which you can ignore).  If it asks you any questions,
       you can just hit <return>.
    9) If you're using a database, add the cron job to purge old data-- see
       the section USING A DATABASE above.

To start the embedded server, run the command "./nph-proxy.cgi start-server"
(or in Windows, "perl nph-proxy.cgi start-server") from the directory where you
uploaded the script.  It will try to use the port you tell it with the "-p"
option (default=443); if that fails, it will use another random port.  After
you run the command, it will tell you the URL to access the proxy with
(including the actual port number), and the process ID of the server.

It may take a while the first time you run it, as it will install some required
Perl modules if you don't already have them; you can ignore the scrolling text.
If it asks you any questions, you can just hit <return>.

To stop the embedded server, run the command "killall nph-proxy.cgi".


AFTER YOU INSTALL:

If you want your proxy to be usable by other people, you need to communicate
the proxy URL to them.  Try to use a secure method to do so, or else the proxy
could easily be discovered by censors and blocked, or worse.

IN PARTICULAR, DON'T BE TEMPTED TO POST YOUR PROXY URL TO ANY PUBLIC SITES THAT
LIST AVAILABLE PROXIES.  IF YOU DO, THE CENSORS WILL QUICKLY SEE YOUR PROXY AND
BLOCK IT, OR THERE MAY BE EVEN WORSE CONSEQUENCES.  THESE PROXY-LISTING SITES
MAY BE USEFUL FOR ANONYMITY, BUT FOR GETTING AROUND CENSORSHIP THEY ARE
DANGEROUS!  THEY MAKE THE CENSORS' JOB EASIER.

IN ADDITION, PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY BE USING PROXIES INSTALLED BY PEOPLE OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY TRUST.

If heavy use of this proxy puts too much load on your server, see "NOTES ON
PERFORMANCE" near the top of the source code. The biggest improvement comes
from running this under mod_perl or FastCGI.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you don't know Perl, but need to configure CGIProxy:

Here's an entry from the FAQ:

    If you don't know Perl, you can guess how to set an option's value by
    emulating the examples already in there.  Variables starting with "$" hold
    single values, and variables starting with "@" hold lists of values.  Lines
    beginning with "#" are comments and are ignored when the program runs.  As
    in most programming languages, 1 means true and 0 means false.  Also as in
    most programming languages, values that are text-like and not numbers (like
    server names or IP addresses) are called "strings" and should be enclosed
    in single or double quotes. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. USAGE:

Call the script directly to start a browsing session.  Once you've gotten
a page through the proxy, everything it links to will automatically go
through the proxy.  You can bookmark pages you browse to, and your
bookmarks will go through the proxy as they did the first time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. HELP IMPROVE THIS PROXY BY TELLING ME:

1) Any kind of links in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or Flash that aren't being
converted, including non-standard tags or links.

2) Any method of introducing JavaScript or other executable content that's not
being filtered out.

3) Any file types that contain links that need to be converted, other than
what's handled now (I know about PDFs).

4) Any other ways you can find to compromise anonymity.


Please verify you're using the latest version of CGIProxy before emailing me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. LIMITS AND BUGS:

ANONYMITY MAY NOT BE PERFECT!!  In particular, there may be some holes where
unproxified JavaScript or Flash content can slip through.  If you find any,
please tell me.  For best anonymity, turn JavaScript and Flash off in your
browser (best), and/or configure CGIProxy to remove scripts.

Ideally, use a database to store cookies.  If you can't, then if you browse
to many sites with cookies, CGIProxy may drop some, causing some sites to not
work.  If this happens, delete some or all of your existing cookies (via the
"Manage Cookies" screen) and try again.

I didn't follow the spec on HTTP proxies, and there are violations of the
protocol.  Actually, this whole concept is a violation of the proxy model,
so I'm not too worried.  If any protocol violations cause you problems,
please let me know.

Only HTTP/HTTPS and FTP are supported so far.

========================================================================

7. OPTIONS:

Here's a list of all the configuration options in CGIProxy, sorted into rough
categories.  The default settings are in square [] brackets, and should work
fine for almost all situations, though see the section "OPTIONS RELATED TO YOUR
SERVER/NETWORK ENVIRONMENT" to be sure.  Also, see the sections "FASTCGI
CONFIGURATION OPTIONS", "EMBEDDED SERVER CONFIGURATION OPTIONS", and "DATABASE
CONFIGURATION OPTIONS" if needed.  For more information on any option, see
the comments in the source code where it is set, in the user configuration section.


OPTIONS RELATED TO YOUR SERVER/NETWORK ENVIRONMENT:
----------------------------------------------------

$PROXY_DIR ["$ENV{HOME}/cgiproxy"]
    The directory on the server where the program can place files.

$RUN_AS_USER [none]
    User ID to run as, in case you need to start the embedded server as root.
    Also used to indicate Web server's user ID when running as a CGI
    or mod_perl script.

$SECRET_PATH ['secret']
    If using FastCGI or the embedded server, set this to an alphanumeric
    sequence of characters that is hard to guess.  It will be part of the
    URL of your proxy.

$LOCAL_LIB_DIR [none]
    The directory used by the local::lib module to install Perl (CPAN) modules.
    Only needed if local::lib is used, i.e. if installing Perl modules not as
    root.

To enable access to secure servers:
    Install the separate packages OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay.  Net::SSLeay is
    automatically installed by running "./nph-proxy.cgi install-modules".

To enable compressed (gzip'd) content:
    If you're not using Perl 5.9.4 or later, then install the IO::Compress::Gzip
    Perl module.  It is automatically installed by running "./nph-proxy.cgi install-modules".

$RUNNING_ON_SSL_SERVER ['']
    Set this if the script is running on an SSL server (i.e. accessed with
    an "https://" URL).  Or, the default value of '' means to guess based on
    the server port:  the script assumes SSL unless the server port is 80.

$NOT_RUNNING_AS_NPH [0]
    Set this if the script is not running as an NPH script (not recommended;
    see comments for possible dangers).

$HTTP_PROXY, $SSL_PROXY, $NO_PROXY [none]
    If this script has to use an HTTP proxy (like a firewall), then set
    $HTTP_PROXY to that proxy's host (and port if needed).  Set $SSL_PROXY
    similarly when using an SSL proxy.  $NO_PROXY is a comma-separated list
    of servers or domains that should be accessed directly, i.e. NOT through
    the proxies in $HTTP_PROXY and $SSL_PROXY.  Also see $USE_PASSIVE_FTP_MODE
    below when using a firewall.

$PROXY_AUTH, $SSL_PROXY_AUTH [none]
    If either or both of the proxies in $HTTP_PROXY and $SSL_PROXY require
    authentication, then set these two variables respectively to the required
    credentials.

$SOCKS_PROXY [none]
    To use a SOCKS 5 proxy (like Tor), set this to the SOCKS 5 proxy's host and
    port.  It's strongly recommended to only use a SOCKS 5 proxy on the same
    server as CGIProxy, as all data is passed in the clear between them.  Also
    see @BANNED_NETWORKS to enable access to localhost.

$SOCKS_USERNAME, $SOCKS_PASSWORD [none]
    If your SOCKS 5 proxy uses username/password authentication, set these.

$USER_FACING_PORT [none]
    If the users see a different port externally than CGIProxy sees internally,
    set this to the port the users see.


FASTCGI CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
------------------------------

$FCGI_SOCKET [8002]
    The local port to listen on for FastCGI communication.

$FCGI_NUM_PROCESSES [100]
    Number of FastCGI processes to maintain (same as "-n" command-line parameter).

$FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_PROCESS [1000]
    How many HTTP requests each FastCGI process should handle before being
    restarted (same as "-m" command-line parameter).


EMBEDDED SERVER CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
--------------------------------------

$CERTIFICATE_FILE, $PRIVATE_KEY_FILE [none]
    Filenames of your certificate (public key) and private key, in PEM format
    and in $PROXY_DIR.

$EMB_USERNAME, $EMB_PASSWORD [none]
    Optional username and password to protect your proxy with.


DATABASE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
-------------------------------

$DB_DRIVER ['SQLite']
    If using a database, set this to "SQLite", "MySQL", or "Oracle".
    Leave it commented out if not using a database.

$DB_SERVER [none]
    If your database isn't running on the same server as CGIProxy, or isn't on
    the default port, then set this to the database server and port in the form
    "db_host:db_port".

$DB_NAME ['cgiproxy']
    Name of the database the program can use.

$DB_USER ['proxy'], $DB_PASS ['']
    CGIProxy accesses the database with this username and password.

$USE_DB_FOR_COOKIES [1]
    Set this to true to use the server-side database to store cookies.  If false,
    will use the old method of storing cookies in the browser and sending all
    cookies with each request, which may result in "Bad Request" errors.


COMMON CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
---------------------------

$TEXT_ONLY [0]
    Allow only text resources through the proxy, to save bandwidth.

$REMOVE_COOKIES [0]
    Ban all cookies to or from all servers.  To allow and ban cookies by
    specific servers, see @ALLOWED_COOKIE_SERVERS and @BANNED_COOKIE_SERVERS.

$REMOVE_SCRIPTS [0]
    Prevent any script content from any server from reaching the browser.
    This includes script statements within HTML pages, external script
    files, etc.  To allow and ban script content by specific servers,
    see @ALLOWED_SCRIPT_SERVERS and @BANNED_SCRIPT_SERVERS.  Anonymity is
    unreliable if you don't either remove scripts, or browse with scripts 
    turned off in your browser.

$FILTER_ADS [0]
    Remove ads from pages, based on the patterns in @BANNED_IMAGE_URL_PATTERNS.
    Also ban ad-related cookies by setting $NO_COOKIE_WITH_IMAGE.

$HIDE_REFERER [0]
    Don't tell servers which link you followed to get to their page.  (Yes,
    it's misspelled on purpose.)

$INSERT_ENTRY_FORM [1]
    At the top of every page, include a small form that lets you enter
    a new URL, change your options, or manage your cookies.

$ALLOW_USER_CONFIG [1]
    Let users set their own $REMOVE_COOKIES, $REMOVE_SCRIPTS, $FILTER_ADS,
    $HIDE_REFERER, and $INSERT_ENTRY_FORM, via checkboxes on the entry form.

sub proxy_encode {}, proxy_decode {}
    (Requires minor programming.)  You can customize the encoding of
    destination URLs by modifying these routines.  The default is a simple
    unobscured URL, but sample obscuring code is included in the comments.
    Note: If you're not removing scripts, then you also need to change
    _proxy_jslib_proxy_encode() and _proxy_jslib_proxy_decode()-- see the
    comments.

sub cookie_encode {}, cookie_decode {}
    (Requires minor programming.)  You can customize the encoding of cookies
    sent to the user's machine by modifying these routines.  The default is a
    simple unobscured cookie, but sample obscuring code is included in the
    comments.
    Note: If you're not removing scripts, then you also need to change
    _proxy_jslib_cookie_encode() and _proxy_jslib_cookie_decode()-- see the
    comments.

@ALLOWED_SERVERS, @BANNED_SERVERS  [empty]
    Allow or ban specific servers from being accessed through the proxy, based
    on their hostname.  Each array is a list of patterns (regular expressions)
    to match, not just single servers.

@BANNED_NETWORKS  [('127', '192.168', '172', '10', '169.254', '244.0.0')]
    Ban specific IP addresses or networks from being accessed through the
    proxy.  Recommended for security when this script is run on a firewall.

@ALLOWED_COOKIE_SERVERS, @BANNED_COOKIE_SERVERS  [empty]
    Allow or ban cookies from specific servers.  Each array is a list of
    patterns (regular expressions) to match, not just single servers.

@ALLOWED_SCRIPT_SERVERS, @BANNED_SCRIPT_SERVERS  [empty]
    Allow or ban script content from specific servers.  Each array is a list
    of patterns (regular expressions) to match, not just single servers.

@BANNED_IMAGE_URL_PATTERNS  [sample list in source code]
    If $FILTER_ADS is set, then ban images that match any pattern in this list.

$RETURN_EMPTY_GIF [0]
    If an image is banned, then replace it with a 1x1 transparent GIF to
    show blank space instead of a broken image icon.

$NO_COOKIE_WITH_IMAGE [0]
    Ban all cookies that come with images or other non-text resources.  Those
    are usually just Web bugs, to track you for marketing purposes.

$QUIETLY_EXIT_PROXY_SESSION [0]
    (NOT for use with anonymous browsing!!!)  For VPN-like installations, let
    the user browse directly from proxied pages to unproxied pages, with no
    intermediate warning screens.  See the comments for more info.

$PROXIFY_SCRIPTS [1]
    Proxify all supported script content.  Currently, only JavaScript is
    supported.

$PROXIFY_SWF [1]
    Support Flash apps, i.e. reroute all network accesses in them back through
    this program.

$ENCODE_URL_INPUT [1]
    When submitting a URL through either the start form or the top form,
    encode it first by using proxy_encode().

$USER_IP_ADDRESS_TEST ['']
    This lets you call an external test to authorize the user.  See comments
    for more details.

$DESTINATION_SERVER_TEST ['']
    This lets you call an external test to determine if the destination
    server is allowed (as opposed to using @ALLOWED_SERVERS and
    @BANNED_SERVERS).  See comments for more details.

%REDIRECTS [none]
    This lets you automatically redirect a URL to another URL, perhaps to one
    that works better through CGIProxy, such as a mobile site.


INSERTING A STANDARD HEADER INTO EACH PAGE:
-------------------------------------------

$INSERT_HTML  [none]
    Insert your own block of HTML into the top of every page.

$INSERT_FILE  [none]
    Insert the contents of the named file into the top of every page.  Can't
    be used with $INSERT_HTML.

$ANONYMIZE_INSERTION [1]
    If $INSERT_HTML or $INSERT_FILE is used, then anonymize that HTML along
    with the rest of the page.

$FORM_AFTER_INSERTION [0]
    If $INSERT_HTML or $INSERT_FILE is used, and $INSERT_ENTRY_FORM is set,
    then put the URL entry form after the inserted HTML instead of before it.

$INSERTION_FRAME_HEIGHT [80 or 50, depending on $ALLOW_USER_CONFIG]
    On pages with frames, make the top frame containing any insertions this
    many pixels high.


MINOR OR SELDOM-USED OPTIONS:
-----------------------------

@PROXY_GROUP  [empty]
    This is an experimental feature which may help with load balancing, or
    may have other creative uses.  Cookies won't work if you use this.
    See the comments for further info.

$SESSION_COOKIES_ONLY [0]
    Force all cookies to expire when the current browser closes.

$MINIMIZE_CACHING [0]
    Try to prevent the user's browser from caching, i.e. from storing anything
    locally.  Better privacy, but consumes more bandwidth and seems slower.

$USER_AGENT  [none]
    Tell servers you're using this browser instead of what you're really using.

@TRANSMIT_HTML_IN_PARTS_URLS  [empty]
    Transmit each part of certain HTML pages back to the user as they are
    received, rather than wait for the whole page.  This is set to a list of
    patterns that match URLs for which you want this treatment.

$USE_PASSIVE_FTP_MODE [1]
    When doing FTP transfers, use "passive mode" instead of "non-passive mode".
    Passive mode tends to work better when this script runs behind a firewall,
    but that varies by network.

$SHOW_FTP_WELCOME [1]
    When showing FTP directories, always display the FTP welcome message,
    instead of never displaying it.

$PROXIFY_COMMENTS [0]
    Proxify the inside of HTML comments as if it's not inside comments.

$USE_POST_ON_START [1]
    Use POST instead of GET when submitting the URL entry form.

$REMOVE_TITLES [0]
    Remove titles from HTML pages.

$NO_BROWSE_THROUGH_SELF [0]
    Prevent the script from calling itself.

$NO_LINK_TO_START [0]
    Don't link to the start page from error pages.

$MAX_REQUEST_SIZE [4194304 = 4 Meg]
    (Obscure.) The largest request that can be handled in certain rare
    situations involving password-protected sites.

$ALLOW_UNPROXIFIED_SCRIPTS [0]
    Allow scripts of unsupported type to pass through the proxy.

$COOKIE_PATH_FOLLOWS_SPEC [0]
    When handling cookies with no path, treat it according to the cookie spec.
    If not set, behave as browsers (erroneously) do, i.e. set the path to "/".

$RESPECT_THREE_DOT_RULE [0]
    Restrict cookie domains as they should be, based on how many dots they
    have.  If not set, behave as browsers (erroneously) do, i.e. loosen
    restrictions on cookie domains with two dots.

$ALERT_ON_CSP_VIOLATION [0]
    When there is a Content Security Policy (CSP) violation, show a message
    to the user.  When not set, just show such error messages in the JavaScript
    console.  This is usually just used for testing.

%TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER_BY_HOST [ "www.facebook.com" => 10 ]
    Multiply timeouts in JavaScript by this much, for the listed servers.
    This can be used to reduce crashes and improve performance on certain
    JavaScript-heavy sites.

$ALLOW_RTMP_PROXY [0]
    (Currently unused.)  Allow the creation of an RTMP proxy process.

========================================================================


8. CH'CH'CH'CH'CHANGES:
-----------------------


2.1.17, released June 11, 2016:
-------------------------------

Fixed to no longer access Window.prototype, which has been recently disallowed
by most browsers.  This makes *many* websites work again, including Gmail,
YouTube, and facebook.

A few other bug fixes.



2.1.16, released November 19, 2015:
-----------------------------------

Cleaned up installation process.  In particular, $RUN_AS_USER and $PROXY_DIR
should now be set before running "./nph-proxy.cgi init", so that file
ownership and permissions can be set correctly.

Added Dutch localization.



2.1.15, released October 21, 2015:
----------------------------------

Database support is MUCH less error-prone.  The database is created when
running "./nph-proxy.cgi init" rather than when running as a CGI script
or manually, which is really how it should have been done all along.  Better
separation of the various roles and permissions.

Added support for SQLite databases, which means you can now use a database
without running a database engine like MySQL/MariaDB or Oracle.  $DB_DRIVER
now defaults to "SQLite", hopefully making "Bad Request" errors a thing of
the past.

There is now a "./nph-proxy.cgi init" command, which a) creates needed
directories, b) installs all Perl modules (like the "install-modules"
command" has done), and c) creates the database.  "install-modules" still
works, but is usually unnecessary.

Accordingly, the installation instructions at install.html have been
updated.

Added support for Storage objects, mostly.

MANY major fixes to CORS support, XMLHttpRequest support, cookie support,
and other areas, making popular sites work again.



2.1.14, released November 13, 2014:
-----------------------------------

Fixed FastCGI support.  Note that $FCGI_SOCKET is now a listening port number
rather than a Unix-domain socket (which wasn't working well anyway).  Be sure
to fix your setting of $FCGI_SOCKET; more details are in the comments above
it in the configuration section.  Also note that the installation page has
been updated with better FastCGI configuration for nginx and Apache.

Added the $USER_FACING_PORT config variable for when one user-facing web server
calls CGIProxy running under other web server software, or any other case when
the port the user sees isn't the same port that CGIProxy sees.

Many bug fixes, making many more sites work.  Major sites are working again,
and in all major browsers.



2.1.13, released October 6, 2014:
---------------------------------

Complete performance rewrite of the JavaScript-modifying code, i.e. proxify_js()
and related routines.  The delay when viewing YouTube video pages is much shorter,
and the load on the server CPU is much less.  :)

Several bug fixes.



2.1.12, released June 21, 2014:
-------------------------------

Now has fully-tested and working IPv6 support.

Works again with older Socket module.  Note that IPv6 support only works with
Socket 1.94 or later.

Several bug fixes.



2.1.11, released May 31, 2014:
------------------------------

Added CORS support, which among other things makes YouTube work again.

Added a page about CGIProxy security, linked to from the footer on the CGIProxy
start page and all error and similar pages.

Added untested IPv6 support-- please tell me how it works if you have IPv6 access!

Several bug fixes.



2.1.10, release April 5, 2014:
------------------------------

Added Spanish and Polish message localization.

Added support for LZMA-compressed SWF files.  Note that this requires the
Perl module IO::Compress::Lzma, which will be installed if you run
"./nph-proxy.cgi install-modules" again, like you did when you first
installed CGIProxy.

Added %TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER_BY_HOST option, to tune performance with certain
sites.

Fixed many bugs, making many sites work better.



2.1.9, released January 27, 2014:
---------------------------------

Added German, Italian, Javanese, and Sundanese message localization.

Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 is now supported with Firefox and Chrome.
Other browsers, and CSP 1.1, will be added when they support CSP.

Added $ALERT_ON_CSP_VIOLATION option.

Various bugs fixes and workarounds.



2.1.8, released October 22, 2013:
---------------------------------

Added Chinese, French, and Indonesian message localization.

The full Gmail now works through CGIProxy.

YouTube once again works through CGIProxy.

Can now use a SOCKS 5 proxy, such as Tor (recommended only on same server).
Configured with $SOCKS_PROXY, $SOCKS_USERNAME, and $SOCKS_PASSWORD .

Database initialization now works better.

Can now use a remote database by setting the $DB_SERVER config variable.

Many bugs fixed or worked around, and privacy holes closed.

Now once again runs on Perl 5.6.1 (one statement in 2.1.7 required Perl 5.10.0).

Shuffles HTTP request headers to better avoid detection.

$ANONYMIZE_INSERTION now defaults to 1.



2.1.7, released July 26, 2013:
------------------------------

CGIProxy now has message localization:  The user can choose an interface in
Arabic, English, Farsi, Russian, or Turkish.  If you would like support for
other languages, please consider translating CGIProxy's messages-- see
http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/translate.html for full details.

The full facebook site now works almost fully through CGIProxy, so it's no
longer redirected to the mobile site by default.  If it's slow for you or your
users, see the comments and suggestions above where %REDIRECTS is set.

Running under FastCGI now works on servers other than just nginx.

Resuming partial downloads is now supported, with partial support of the
Range: header.

The JavaScript library (jslib) is now gzipped when possible, to save bandwidth.
Should have done this a while ago.

Fixed error with "-c" in usage message; sorry about that.

Added support for Content-Security-Policy: header, though it's disabled until
the header is better defined and browsers support it.

Many bugs fixed, making many sites work better.



2.1.6, released February 4, 2013:
--------------------------------

Now can run as a FastCGI script.

Now can run without an external HTTP server, by using its own embedded secure
HTTP server.

Installation is easier, as Perl modules can be automatically installed
(including under your home directory) by running
"./nph-proxy.cgi install-modules" from the command line.  See the $LOCAL_LIB_DIR
config option, if you need to install the modules and you're not root.

Windows support has improved.

Documentation has been improved, especially for installation.

Command-line usage is now documented; run "./nph-proxy.cgi -?" for usage.

There are some new config options, mostly for FastCGI support, the embedded
server, and database support.

Some of the configuration section has been rearranged; most potentially
needed config options are now near the top.

Fixed a bug handling spaces in path when using proxy_encode().



2.1.5b, released November 10, 2012:
----------------------------------

Added redirection for Gmail to %REDIRECTS ; redirects to HTML-only version.



2.1.5, released October 21, 2012:
---------------------------------

Now optionally uses a server-side database to store cookies, which fixes
"Bad Request" errors when user has too many cookies.  Can use either MySQL
or Oracle.  Configure this with $DB_DRIVER, $DB_USER, $DB_PASS, and
$USE_DB_FOR_COOKIES .

Now supports a simple mechanism to automatically redirect pages that aren't
handled well by CGIProxy.  For example, www.facebook.com is redirected to
m.facebook.com (mobile), until we can get www.facebook.com working better.
This is configured with the %REDIRECTS hash.

17 bugs fixed, mostly in JavaScript support but some in Flash and HTML support too.



2.1.4, released May 8, 2012:
----------------------------

Fixed a bug with chunked responses, making captcha work better.

Closed some privacy holes in JavaScript and Flash support.

Fixed some small bugs, making more pages work better.

Added "Delete all cookies" link to top of cookie management screen.



2.1.3, released April 27, 2012:
-------------------------------

Improved Flash support, including better support for online video.  No delay
with YouTube anymore.

Improved support for Same-Origin Policy (browser security).

Other security fixes.

Other fixes and workarounds, making more pages work correctly.



2.1.2, released April 8, 2012:
------------------------------

Added "download" link to footer.

Fixed "SSL options" bug.

No longer fails in Windows because of getpwuid() call.

Various security fixes.

Various small fixes to make more pages work better.

Internal: rewrote _proxy_jslib_handle() and _proxy_jslib_assign() more cleanly,
using _proxy_jslib_instanceof() instead of the error-prone _proxy_jslib_object_type()
(which was removed).  Still works around many browser bugs.  :P



2.1.1, released January 19, 2012:
---------------------------------

$ENCODE_URL_INPUT is now on by default, and is fixed to work better in all
major browsers.

Link to CGIProxy home page in the footer is now proxified.

Now supports jQuery-based sites better.

Added support for a few non-standard HTTP request headers.

Works better with captcha.

$NO_COOKIE_WITH_IMAGE is now off by default, to support captcha.

Many small fixes and workarounds, including several privacy and security fixes.



2.1, released December 9, 2011:
-------------------------------

Flash 9 and later is now supported, which among other things means YouTube
works through CGIProxy again.

Changed flag segment of full URLs to something less obvious.

Now supports "data:" URIs.

Now supports ECMAScript (JavaScript) version 5.

Many fixes in JavaScript support and elsewhere.

No longer eats memory when connecting to secure servers.

$PROXIFY_SWF is now set by default.

Now uses the Encode module instead of the old utf8:: stuff.

Added two config options $PROXY_DIR and $ALLOW_RTMP_PROXY, though they're not
used yet.



2.1beta19, released December 25, 2008:
--------------------------------------

Fixed a couple of bugs with cookies, so they (including logins) should work
better.

Fixed so that Safari no longer chokes on StorageList handling.

Various other small fixes.



2.1beta18, released August 10, 2008:
------------------------------------

Certain pages were very slow in MSIE due to the way MSIE implements
Array.pop(), so a lot of code was rewritten to avoid using Array.pop().  Those
pages now function at normal speed in MSIE.  Some pages see an improvement
of 10x or better.

proxify_js() is now about 5% faster due to reworking of $div_ok setting.

Now handles "application/xhtml+xml" content correctly.

$REMOVE_SCRIPTS and $HIDE_REFERER both now default to 0 (false).

Various small fixes, workarounds, and cleanup.



2.1beta17, released March 11, 2008:
-----------------------------------

Fixed a couple of bugs with SWF (Flash) support.  In particular, <param> tags
are now proxified correctly when in certain <object>s, and thus youtube.com now
works when using MSIE.



2.1beta16, released March 3, 2008:
----------------------------------

Includes a ton of fixes and workarounds in JavaScript support, making more
sites work through it.

Includes a fair amount of performance improvement too.

Added experimental support for Shockwave Flash (SWF) apps.  If you set
$PROXIFY_SWF=1, the script will proxify the SWF bytecode so that any
network accesses go back through the same script.  It works with many but
not all Flash apps.  Sometimes it can slow down a page, if the page has e.g.
lots of Flash ads.

Fixed port-handling in HTTP Basic authentication support.

Several other small bug fixes, cleanup, and comments.



2.1beta15, released October 26, 2006:
-------------------------------------

Fixed bug handling "javascript:" URLs that was causing some sites to fail.

Fixed bug in _proxy_jslib_cookie_encode() and _proxy_jslib_cookie_decode(),
in the commented-out rot-13 line.  Cookies should now work when using rot-13.

"about:blank" pages no longer generate the "WARNING:" page.

In the start page, the URL entry field now initially has focus (only if JS
is running).

Added support for Element.getElementsByTagName to _proxy_jslib_handle()
(though it's done in the form of "Node.getElementsByTagName").

Now explicitly defaults the first argument of "Document.open()" to text/html.
This is supposed to happen anyway, but not all browsers do it correctly when
writing to a frame.

Proxification of top-level "return" statements should now work better in a
couple of ways.

Several more small fixes and cleanup, making more sites work.



2.1beta14, released October 16, 2006:
-------------------------------------

Better handling of "javascript:" URLs.

Now correctly handles "delete(...)" .

Various browser bugs/crashes are now trapped by try/catch blocks so they're
not fatal.

More erroneous HTML and JavaScript is now worked around.

Many more small fixes and workarounds.



2.1beta13, released September 12, 2006:
---------------------------------------

The $TRANSMIT_HTML_IN_PARTS config variable has been removed; now you only
need to set @TRANSMIT_HTML_IN_PARTS_URLS .  Use of both was redundant.

Now correctly handles UTF-8 content.

Authorization cookies are now associated with the server and port, rather than
just the server.

Worked around MSIE bug that shifts centered content to the right.

Now works around more erroneous HTML, JavaScript, and browser behavior.

Other minor fixes.



2.1beta12, released June 6, 2006:
---------------------------------

Now optionally supports compression (gzip) of message bodies, if the
Compress::Zlib Perl module is installed.  This also helps with certain server
bugs.

To help with pages that are returned in parts with long delays between those
parts, you can now use the $TRANSMIT_HTML_IN_PARTS and
@TRANSMIT_HTML_IN_PARTS_URLS options to have CGIProxy process and return each
piece of HTML as it receives it rather than wait for the whole page.  This
helps with certain library database queries, for example.

Further improved CSS handling, including better display of the top form.

Improved handling of "&#nnn;" HTML entities.

Better updating of the top form when using frames.

When $TEXT_ONLY is set, there are no longer any wasteful attempts to get the
images (unless $RETURN_EMPTY_GIF is set).  Also, $RETURN_EMPTY_GIF now defaults
to 0 .

Now handles JavaScript's deprecated with() statement.

Now handles Document.referrer .

Cookie values are now allowed to have spaces in them, even though that's
technically illegal; unfortunately, some sites require them to work.  If this
causes any problems, please let me know.

Other minor fixes.



2.1beta11, released March 14, 2006:
-----------------------------------

Improved (though not yet perfect) CSS handling.

Now uses a different system to track which elements have been proxified.
(PLEASE tell me if you find any privacy holes, i.e. when the browser
makes a direct connection to the end server when it should be going though
CGIProxy.)

Fixed a hang when using MSIE and IIS.

HTML (e.g. innerHTML) is no longer doubly-proxified when using "+=".

Improved handling of &#nnn; -type entities.

No longer inserts "<!-- resource has been modified by proxy -->"; it was
becoming more trouble than it's worth.

Better handling of data retrieved through XMLHttpRequest.

Cleaner support of Document.domain .

Many other minor fixes, workarounds, and cleanup, mostly in JavaScript support.



2.1beta10, released December 6, 2005:
-------------------------------------

Now supports UTF-16 pages, if using Perl 5.8.0 or later.

Now supports query-only URLs.

Window.open with a relative URL is now handled correctly.

In JavaScript, (non-standard) octal numbers and characters are now handled.

Now allows (erroneous) commas in cookie values, created by at least one server.

Now allows (erroneous) line terminators in JavaScript string literals if
  preceded by a "\", since browsers seem to allow it.

Many other minor fixes, mostly in JavaScript support.



2.1beta9, released October 27, 2005:
------------------------------------

Cleaned up URL handling in proxy_encode(), proxy_decode(), and their JS
counterparts.  Those routines are now back to their old format in which
they contain only user-configurable statements.  The "do not remove" code
has been moved into wrapper functions; anywhere proxy_encode() is called
should now call wrap_proxy_encode() instead, and the same is true for the
three other related routines.

@BANNED_NETWORKS now includes the whole 127.x.x.x subnet.

Cookies are now handled more like browsers handle them (though not as the
spec calls for), in a couple of ways.

In the JavaScript code, reworked handling of "delete", preincrement, and
predecrement.  Those operators are now handled much better.

Other minor fixes.



2.1beta8, released August 23, 2005:
-----------------------------------

Now more properly encodes all "?", "#", and others in default proxy_encode().
This includes further working around aforementioned Apache bug with PATH_INFO.

Now supports Accept-Language: header in requests, which means that pages will
more often be returned in the expected language.

Added support for query-only URLs, i.e. those beginning with "?".  Don't know
why this never came up before.

A couple fixes and workarounds in JavaScript support.

Other minor fixes.



2.1beta7, released June 28, 2005:
---------------------------------

Added a "Report a bug" link in the top form, which will hopefully result
in more bug reports.

Now supports (erroneous) JavaScript that contains the string "</script"
within it, as browsers do.

Worked around an Apache bug (fixed in 2.0.55) that causes problems when
PATH_INFO contains "//".

Fixed a few bugs in JavaScript handling.

Other minor fixes.



2.1beta6, released May 24, 2005:
--------------------------------

JavaScript is now supported, i.e. JavaScript is modified as necessary to
route all network accesses back through the script.

$PROXIFY_SCRIPTS is now on by default.

Unsupported scripts are now removed by default; to not remove them, use
$ALLOW_UNPROXIFIED_SCRIPTS.

Top form has been put into its own one-cell table, with a white background.
This makes it readable on many pages where it wasn't before.

Checkbox text in top form now uses <label> tags, to allow clicking on text.

Now can encode URLs before submitting them, if you set $ENCODE_URL_INPUT.

Now supports external tests for valid user IP address ($USER_IP_ADDRESS_TEST)
and valid destination server ($DESTINATION_SERVER_TEST).  Both may be either
a command-line program, or a CGI script on a remote server.  These features
were added at the request of (and paid for by) the International Broadcasting
Bureau.

No longer times out after 10 minutes, which will help with large files.

Added some more appropriate values to @BANNED_NETWORKS.

Cookies with no path specified now use a path of "/", even though that
violates the spec, because that's how browsers treat them.  If you want
to follow the spec instead, you can set $COOKIE_PATH_FOLLOWS_SPEC.

Illegal cookie domains that contain only two dots but are not in one of
the seven main TLDs are now allowed by default, because that's how browsers
behave.  You can follow the spec instead by setting $RESPECT_THREE_DOT_RULE.

Many other minor fixes, and workarounds for browser bugs and buggy sites.



2.0.1, released November 19, 2002:
----------------------------------

This release improves compatibility and installability in a few environments;
it doesn't really add new features.  In particular:

An SSL proxy is now supported with the $SSL_PROXY option, analogous to
$HTTP_PROXY.  Authentication for it is handled with $SSL_PROXY_AUTH,
analogous to $PROXY_AUTH.

The $RUNNING_ON_WINDOWS option is no longer needed, and so no longer exists--
relevant code now determines the OS automatically when needed, or is handled
another way.

Sockets now work correctly on BSDI and possibly other systems, where before
the script generated messages like "Address family not supported by protocol
family" and possibly others.  It works now because socket address structures
are created with the general pack_sockaddr_in() and inet_aton() functions from
the Socket module, instead of the traditional hard-coded "pack('S n a4 x8')"
method.  The new way is more "correct", given that we're already loading the
Socket module anyway.  It should help for future IPv6 support too.

All page insertions, including the initial "<!-- resource ... -->" comment, are
now inserted *after* any initial <!doctype> declaration, to avoid confusing
MSIE 6.0, which does not allow comments before an initial <!doctype>.  The
problem showed up as subtle errors in page elements (like fonts, etc.) when
using MSIE; some or all of these problems should go away now.

Cache behavior when using a caching HTTP proxy should be correct now, because
Pragma: and Cache-Control: headers (if available) are now passed through to
the outgoing request.  Before, caches would not always refresh as expected,
so page reloads didn't always work.

Fixed a compilation error when using certain older versions of Perl.



2.0, released September 18, 2002:
---------------------------------

This is a MAJOR release, even though most of the changes are internal.  Some
things about the 2.0 script are fundamentally different from the 1.x series.
Here's a list of changes, roughly categorized:


---- Visible new features and changes: ----

Now supports SSL, i.e. can retrieve pages on secure servers.  For this to
work, the separate packages OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay must be installed.  If
they are not installed, then CGIProxy still works but cannot download pages
from secure servers.  Also, it is strongly recommended to run CGIProxy on a
secure server when SSL is supported, or else secure data will be compromised
on the link between the browser and CGIProxy.

The top entry form now has an "UP" link, which links to the parent directory of
the current URL.  The idea comes from the (quite useful) button in Konqueror.

Handling of top insertions has been cleaned up-- FTP directory listings now
include the correct insertions, and other cleaner behavior.


---- New or changed config options: ----

$RUNNING_ON_SSL_SERVER is now a three-way option:  If it's set to '', then
assume an SSL server if and only if port 443 is being used.  Besides being a
good default, this lets you put the script where it can be served by both a
secure server and a non-secure server.

Perl 4 is no longer supported.  CGIProxy should run fine with Perl 5.004 or
later.  Better yet, upgrade to Perl 5.6.1 or later if you can-- future
versions of CGIProxy may require that for some features.

FTP requests now use passive (PASV) mode by default, though you can use
non-passive mode by setting $USE_PASSIVE_FTP_MODE=0.

$HTTP_PROXY and $NO_PROXY are now used instead of $ENV{'http_proxy'} and
$ENV{'no_proxy'}.

For VPN-like installations, there is now a $QUIETLY_EXIT_PROXY_SESSION option
that allows a smooth transition from browsing an intranet through the proxy
to browsing external sites directly, without getting intermediate warning
screens.  It's not meant for any situation where anonymity is important.  See
the comments where it is set for more details.

Set the new $SESSION_COOKIES_ONLY option to make all cookies expire when the
browser closes.

Set the new $MINIMIZE_CACHING option to minimize any caching that may be done
by the browser, by using appropriate HTTP response headers.  Cacheability of
various responses has also been cleaned up in general.

If for some reason you want content (e.g. HTML) inside <!-- --> comments to
be proxified like the rest, set the new $PROXIFY_COMMENTS option.

Improved the sample list of ad servers in @BANNED_IMAGE_URL_PATTERNS.

Cleaner and slightly different handling of $INSERT_HTML and $INSERT_FILE;
see comments in user config section for details.

$FASTER_HTML_LESS_PRIVACY no longer exists, because it's no longer relevant
with the new HTML-parsing structure (see below).


---- For programmers: ----

SSL support was implemented as a package that implements a tied filehandle,
called "SSL_Handle".  The idea came from the Net::SSLeay::Handle module,
which for a couple reasons wasn't suitable to use directly.  The SSL_Handle
package may be useful in other SSL applications, though this version is not
a full implementation.  It does buffer its input, though, which can make it
a much faster alternative to Net::SSLeay's ssl_read_until() routine.

The entire section of code that modifies an HTML response (roughly 20-25% of
the whole program) has been completely rewritten from scratch, and has a new
structure.  It's MUCH cleaner and slightly smaller than before, and is now
encapsulated in the routine proxify_html().  It handles the heterogeneity of
HTML correctly, i.e. non-HTML content that can exist within HTML (like
scripts, stylesheets, comments, or SGML declarations) is correctly separated
out and handled according to type.  Also, tags are fully parsed into
attributes and rebuilt if needed, instead of hacking it with long regular
expressions as before; this removes a family of potential bugs and a lot of
messy code.  Overall, the results are more accurate, and the new structure is
much more solid, flexible, and extensible, and much easier to work with than
before; it should let us solve any new problems in the "right" way when they
arise.  :) :)

Many other sections of code have been partially or entirely rewritten, and
behavior is generally cleaner.

Global variables are now handled much more cleanly, especially regarding
their persistence when using mod_perl.  Variables are now (almost) completely
divided between UPPER_CASE constants which retain their values between runs,
and lower_case variables which are reset for each run.  After the user config
section is a constant initialization section; both are run only during the
first run of the script, and are skipped for efficiency during subsequent
runs under mod_perl.  The config and initialization sections have been
arranged more carefully than before, for clarity and other reasons.  Several
variables have had their semantics clarified.

NOTE: If you modified the code in an earlier version and used certain config
variables, you should review the new code before inserting the same changes.
For example, a variable like $REMOVE_SCRIPTS should normally be replaced by
$e_remove_scripts; the former is the config setting that never changes
anymore, while the latter reflects the value used for this run of the program
(which the user might change via a checkbox).  There are several similar
variables.  Also, avoid modifying UPPER_CASE variables, because those will
retain their values between runs under mod_perl... unless that's what you
want.


---- Other stuff: ----

The HTTP client in CGIProxy now uses HTTP/1.1 if the browser uses HTTP/1.1.
Before, only certain HTTP/1.1 features like the Host: header were supported;
now, all required HTTP/1.1 client features are supported, so CGIProxy is
"conditionally compliant" with HTTP/1.1 regarding its client functions, as
per the HTTP spec.  CGIProxy can't control all server functions, but for
those that it does (such as the Date: header), it complies with HTTP/1.1.

Improved detection of text vs. non-text when supporting $NO_COOKIE_WITH_IMAGE,
which makes some pages behave better.

Many changes to take advantage of Perl 5, such as "use strict", better
regular expressions, references, and cleaner code all over the place.

Various other bugs fixed, privacy holes closed, performance improvements, UI
improvements, code rearrangement, and cleanup.



1.5.1, released February 7, 2002:
---------------------------------

Headers are no longer split on commas, which among other things means that
cookies work again.  :P

A couple other minor bug fixes.



1.5, released November 26, 2001:
--------------------------------

Many changes this time around, some major, some minor.  The code is about
50% larger.  Here's a list of changes, roughly categorized:


---- Most visible new features and changes: ----

A new cookie management screen lets the user view and selectively delete any
cookies being sent through the proxy.

On pages with frames, any insertion (such as the small URL entry form) is now
in its own top frame.

Cookies may now be encoded with the cookie_encode() and cookie_decode()
routines, similar in concept to proxy_encode() and proxy_decode().


---- Making more pages work: ----

Referrer information, required by some servers, is now optionally sent to
the server.

Certain pages with Flash or other embedded objects now work better.

HTTP URLs which include authentication in them (e.g. "username:password")
are now supported.

Links to "javascript:" URLs are handled in a more friendly way.

Inline frames (i.e. <iframe> tags) are now handled like frames with regard
to insertions.


---- New config options: ----

If you're running this on or inside a firewall, use @BANNED_NETWORKS to ban
access to single hosts and whole networks by IP address.  This is more
reliable than banning by hostname.

Set $REMOVE_TITLES to remove titles from HTML pages.

Error pages now link to the starting page, unless $NO_LINK_TO_START is set.


---- For programmers: ----

There's now a simple framework for handling any arbitrary MIME types that
may need modification (e.g. changing embedded links); see proxify_block().
To add handling for a MIME type, add code in proxify_block() and add your
MIME type into @TYPES_TO_HANDLE (and @OTHER_TYPES_TO_REGISTER if needed).

Additionally, a framework to proxify script content is in place:  All script
content will be routed through the MIME type handler if $PROXIFY_SCRIPTS is
set.  You need to add your own code to proxify_block() for this to actually
do anything.

Parsing of the flag segment of PATH_INFO has been encapsulated into the
routines pack_flags() and unpack_flags().


---- Invisible, or bug fixes: ----

Style sheets are handled much better, including <style> elements, "style"
attributes, and external style sheets.  CSS is explicitly handled, but the
framework is in place for other types.

Certain tags in HTML specify the expected MIME type of the resource they
link to; this is now handled better.

The list of script MIME types is now more complete.

Cookies with the "secure" clause are now supported, though it's never
actually used without SSL support.

Strengthened $NO_COOKIE_WITH_IMAGE support by requiring an appropriate Accept:
header, to guard against certain sneaky Web bugs like at zdnet.com.

The script's URL is now generated using the Host: header if available,
instead of SERVER_NAME; this tends to have better results.

Any resource with an unidentified MIME type is now treated as text/html,
like Netscape does.  This is safest.

<a href> attributes containing character entities are now handled better when
proxy_encode()'ing is used.

FTP URLs with spaces in them are now handled better, in a couple of ways.

Various tags, attributes, and HTTP headers that require special treatment
are now handled more correctly.

Various regex fixes, other minor bug fixes, and cleanup.



1.4.1 and 1.4.1-SSL, released March 8, 2001:
--------------------------------------------

CPU load was decreased 15% with two simple changes that I should have thought
of long ago.

Fixed error with <meta> "refresh" tags that caused proxy to loop through
itself.

Fixed problem with user-chosen URL entry form.



1.4-SSL, released February 22, 2001:
------------------------------------

This is a special version that can retrieve pages from SSL servers.  It
is based on version 1.4, and otherwise works pretty identically to that
release.



1.4, released February 10, 2001:
----------------------------------

You can now optionally insert a compact version of the initial entry form
into the top of every downloaded page, by setting $INSERT_ENTRY_FORM=1.  The
form also displays the URL you're currently viewing.  This is selectable by
the user like the three original user-selectable options.  Frames are handled
correctly, i.e. it's not inserted in frames, because that would be really
ugly.  That was the hard part.

You can also insert your own block of HTML if desired: specify it either as a
fixed string in $INSERT_HTML, or name a file to be inserted in $INSERT_FILE.

For consistency, the URL format was changed slightly-- the initial flags in
PATH_INFO are always there and are now five in number.  So any bookmarks
saved through the proxy will have to be converted or recreated.  If there's
enough demand, I can write a simple converter each time I change the URL
format.

The user-entered hostname is now always lowercased, since host names are
case-insensitive.

Fixed a minor bug in 1.3.2 having to do with PATH_INFO encoding.



1.3.2, released February 3, 2001:
---------------------------------

By popular demand, you can now restrict which servers the proxy can access,
like the online demo does.  This is configured with the lists
@ALLOWED_SERVERS and @BANNED_SERVERS.

For FTP transfers, a "Content-Length:" header is now returned when
guessable.  This lets some browsers show you the percentage progress.

Pseudo-headers created by <meta http-equiv> tags are now handled like real
HTTP headers.  Internally, the handling of HTTP headers has been cleaned up.

If you absolutely, truly, can't run NPH scripts on your server, there is
now an option to run as best as possible as a normal non-NPH CGI script.
For this to work, your server MUST support the "Status:" CGI response
header.  All servers are supposed to support it, but not all do.

There is now a $NO_BROWSE_THROUGH_SELF option which prevents the proxy from
calling itself, which is usually a mistake anyway.

Proxy authentication (the "Proxy-Authorization:" request header) is now
supported in a limited way, with $PROXY_AUTH.

Regexes have been improved to match tag attributes better, and a related
privacy hole was fixed.

URLs with spaces (which are a bad idea anyway) are now more likely to be
handled as expected.



1.3.1, released June 6, 2000:
-----------------------------

Script now runs correctly under mod_perl (requires at least Perl 5.004).

Script now runs correctly on an SSL server, if $RUNNING_ON_SSL_SERVER is set.

Main URL-conversion loop runs almost twice as fast (40% less CPU time), with
a fix I should have noticed a long time ago.

Login for HTTP Basic authentication is now submitted with POST instead of
GET, for better security.

Fixed privacy hole when servers didn't return Content-Type: header.



1.3, released April 8, 2000:
-----------------------------

Anonymity has been improved, especially regarding JavaScript or other
script content.  Before it was an afterthought; now it's being implemented
as completely as possible.  If you know any anonymity holes, please tell
me.  I'm especially interested in knowing any MIME types that identify
scripts.

In particular:

. Much more JavaScript is filtered out than before.  As far as I know, all
  of it is removed:  in <script> blocks, in style sheets, in HTML attributes,
  wherever indicated by HTTP headers, and other places.

. By default, $REMOVE_SCRIPTS is set to true.

. A potential privacy hole from a bug in Internet Explorer is protected.

You can now select which servers to allow scripts from, by setting
@ALLOWED_SCRIPT_SERVERS and @BANNED_SCRIPT_SERVERS.


If several people share a proxy, they can customize their own settings if
you set $ALLOW_USER_CONFIG.

Large files and streaming media are now supported, by transmitting the
data from the server as it arrives, rather than receiving the whole
resource before sending it to the client.  This works for both HTTP and
FTP.

HTTP Basic authentication is now supported.  (I sure hope people use it,
because it's the most elaborate and convoluted hack of the whole program.)

There's an experimental load-balancing feature.  If you set @PROXY_GROUP
to a set of URL's of cooperating proxies, they'll randomly distribute the
load among them.  This may help or hinder privacy, and it may have other
uses too.  Let me know if you find those uses.

For those who like to mess with the code, there are some neat new internal
mechanisms.  Cookies have now been extended to handle multiple tasks (had
to for Basic authentication), and there's a new internally-handled URL
scheme "x-proxy" that lets you plug in whatever magic functionality you
want (had to for Basic authentication).

There is no longer a startproxy.cgi.  It was swallowed by the main script.
It was becoming a vanishingly small percentage of the overall code.

More HTML tags are transformed, whichever non-standard tags people
reported to me (thanks!).

A couple of non-standard HTTP headers with URLs are now transformed
correctly.

If you're running on Windows, you can now set a configuration flag, and
CGIProxy will work around a couple problems on that platform.

$SUPPORT_COOKIES has been reversed, and renamed to $REMOVE_COOKIES.  This
makes it more analogous to $REMOVE_SCRIPTS, and each have their
@ALLOWED...  and @BANNED... server lists.

@BANNED_COOKIE_SERVERS and $NO_COOKIE_WITH_IMAGE have changed slightly--
they now take effect even when $FILTER_ADS isn't set.  They're more
associated with the $REMOVE_COOKIES flag now.

The initial URL-entry form may now submit using POST instead of GET,
based on the setting of $USE_POST_ON_START.  This is because some
filters apparently search outgoing URIs, but not POST request bodies.

FTP now follows symbolic links correctly, and another FTP bug or two were
fixed.



1.2, released September 11, 1999:
---------------------------------

The internal structure was rearranged in a big way, to support multiple
protocols more cleanly.  Previously, HTTP was ingrained throughout; now
it's more modular.

FTP is now supported.

@ALLOWED_COOKIE_SERVERS lets you only accept cookies from certain servers.

@BANNED_COOKIE_SERVERS and @ALLOWED_COOKIE_SERVERS are now lists of Perl
patterns (regular expressions) to match, rather than literal host names.
This lets you allow or forbid whole sets of servers rather than listing
each server individually.  For more information on Perl patterns, read the
Perl documentation.  nph-proxy.cgi has a note in the user config section
that may help enough.

You can remove scripts from HTML pages by setting $REMOVE_SCRIPTS=1.  This
helps with anonymity somewhat by removing some JavaScript (but not all!).
It also removes most popup ads.  :)

The HEAD method is now supported more cleanly.

Rare net_path form of relative URL (i.e. like "//host.com/path/etc") is
now supported, for completeness and safety.

The default lists of cookie and ad servers are a bit better.



1.1, released March 9, 1999:
----------------------------

The whole format of the target URL in PATH_INFO was restructured.  It can
be encoded however the user wishes.  This gets around PATH_INFO clashes in
various servers, solving most problems regarding server incompatibilities
I've heard about.

Cookies are now optionally supported (but off by default).

Banner ads can be filtered out.  Only a simple set of URL patterns are
filtered out by default, but it's easy to add more entries to
@BANNED_IMAGE_URL_PATTERNS.

Cookies from ad servers are filtered out (at least the main ones).  Again,
the default list in @BANNED_COOKIE_SERVERS is simple, but you can easily
add more.

Binary files are no longer getting messed up on Windows.

More HTTP headers are fixed to point back through the proxy.

Under some conditions in 1.0, extra processes would hang around for hours
and drag the system.  Alex Freed added a timeout to solve this for now.  I
can't reproduce the problem, so any info is appreciated.  [9-9-1999: It
may be a bug in older Apaches, fixed by upgrading to Apache 1.3.6 or
better.  Julian Haight reports the same problem with other scripts on
Apache 1.3.3, but not with Apache 1.3.6.]

Internally: code was cleaned up, URL-parsing was improved, and relative
URL calculation was redone.



1.0, released August 3, 1998:
-----------------------------

Initial release.
